    "So, the first thing you should note about this question is that it deals with an absolute value. That is what the two vertical lines mean around the expression $6x+4$. Now, we are told that the absolute value of the expression equals 16. Now it could mean that $6x+4$ is actually 16, but it could also be the case that $6x+4$ without the brackets equals *negative* 16. That's what an absolute value does, it takes something positive and leaves it positive and it takes something negative and turns it positive. So, we set up two equations, \n",
    "$$6x+4=16$$ \n",
    "$$ 6x+4=-16$$\n",
    "Now, we just solve for x in both equations. For the first:\n",
    "$$6x+4=16$$ Subtract 4 from both sides, $$6x=12$$ now divide both sides by 6 to isolate x and we have our answer. $$x=\\frac{12}{6}=2$$ So that is our answer, $x=2$. We can solve the other equation and get $x=-\\frac{10}{3}$ but we don't have to as the problem asks us to solve for $x>0$, so we are done. Note that you can see the correct answers on page 121 of the *Solved* text book."
